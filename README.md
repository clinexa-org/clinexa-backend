# Clinexa Backend – Development Branch

## 🚀 Overview  
This branch represents the **active development environment** for the Clinexa Backend.  
All sprint work, features, bug fixes, and enhancements are integrated here **before** being merged into `main`.

`development` is the **integration branch** used by the team to prepare stable releases.

## 🧱 Branch Purpose

- Collects code from all Sprint branches  
- Allows teams to test features together  
- Ensures compatibility before pushing to `main`  
- Prevents breaking the production-ready code  
- Supports parallel development for multiple features

## 🌿 Branching Strategy (GitFlow)

### 🔵 Main Branch  
Production-ready code only.  
No direct commits allowed.

### 🟣 Development Branch  
Integration branch.  
All sprints merge **into development**, not directly into `main`.
